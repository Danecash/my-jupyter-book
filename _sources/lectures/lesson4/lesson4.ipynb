    "## Main Types of Deep Learning Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning neural networks come in various architectures, each suited to different types of tasks and data. The most basic form is the **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**, also known simply as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). In these networks, data moves in one directionâ€”from input nodes, through hidden layers, to output nodes. Each layer consists of neurons, which are mathematical functions that compute a weighted sum of inputs and pass it through an activation function. These networks are primarily used for tasks where data has a fixed-size input, like image classification or simple regression problems. They are the foundation of more complex neural network types.\n",

    "**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are specialized for processing grid-like data, such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. Convolutional layers apply filters (kernels) across the input data to produce feature maps, capturing patterns like edges, textures, and shapes. This is followed by pooling layers, which reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps and help in achieving spatial invariance. CNNs are highly effective for image-related tasks, including object detection, image segmentation, and facial recognition, due to their ability to detect local patterns and hierarchical structures.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, including their variants like **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** networks, are designed to handle sequential data. Unlike feedforward networks, RNNs have connections that form directed cycles, enabling them to maintain a memory of previous inputs. This makes them ideal for tasks where context and order are crucial, such as natural language processing, time series prediction, and speech recognition. LSTMs and GRUs address the problem of vanishing gradients in traditional RNNs by incorporating mechanisms to retain long-term dependencies and improve learning from long sequences. These networks have been pivotal in advancements in machine translation, text generation, and other sequence-based applications.\n",
